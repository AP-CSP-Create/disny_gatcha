# disny_gatcha
Class project- Passion Project
This is my first big Python project. I worked on it with a partner during my AP Computer Science Principles Class. This final allowed us to create a project that was related to our passions while showcasing the skills learned throughout the school year. We took our love for Disney characters and interest in Gatcha games and Discord bots that generate random characters to model our project afterward. Feel free to enjoy the short Gatcha game.
